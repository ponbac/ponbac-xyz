## The problem

When working on a **React** project with translations, it's easy to make mistakes. For example, you might forget to add a translation for a new string, or you might accidentally use a string that doesn't exist. These mistakes can be hard to catch, especially if you're working on a large project with many translations.

Accidentally deploying a broken translation is not the end of the world, but it will make your users question your attention to detail. It's also a waste of time, as you'll have to deploy a fix as soon as possible.
